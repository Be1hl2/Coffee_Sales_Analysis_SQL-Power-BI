Calendar Heat Map with Hover Interaction

A Calendar Heat Map is a powerful visual tool used to represent daily data trends over a calendar layout. In sales analysis, it highlights the variation in sales volume across days of a selected month using color intensities â€” typically, darker shades represent higher values, and lighter shades represent lower values.

One of the key features of this visualization is the interactive tooltip (hovering) functionality. When users hover over a specific day, a tooltip appears displaying detailed metrics such as:

Total Sales , Total Orders, Total Quantity Sold, Date, Month-over-Month (MoM) change, 

This interaction enhances data exploration, allowing users to instantly view granular day-level insights without cluttering the main calendar view. It's especially useful for identifying sales spikes, dips, or recurring patterns on specific weekdays or holidays.
